Instead, you and the Onebit agree to arbitrate Disputes that are not resolved informally (as described below) through binding arbitration (i.e. the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it) instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court). 
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. You and the Onebit agree that any dispute is personal to you and the Onebit and that any such dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration or to an arbitration in which an individual attempt to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.

          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Process. You and the Onebit agree that each will notify the other, in writing, of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to the Onebit shall be provided by sending an email to info@onebit.com. Your notice must include (1) your name, postal address, and email address; (2) a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (3) the specific action that you are seeking. If you and the Onebit cannot resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the Onebit receiving the notice, either you or Onebit may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 9, commence an arbitration proceeding. You and the Onebit agree that any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, you and the Onebit agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute).
